The above scripts compute nonlinear energy transfer flux in spectral space. 

The first script loads the entire 3D MHD snapshot at the same time, after which computations are performed. 
Thus, this first script is useful only for lower-resolution simulations.

The second script is customized to work with 4096 x 4096 x 8192 grid-point simulation data, 
for which a single MHD snapshot (3 components of velocity and 3 components of magnetic fields) is 6 terabytes.
